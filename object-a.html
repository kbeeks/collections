    <h1><span class="bg-color2">BILL MURRAY</span></h1>

<p>
    <h3>Our sweet, senior pup passed away in late 2020 and for the first time in the 10 years that we’ve lived here, groundhogs have moved in. We saw Bill a few times and realized he had set up a burrow under our barn (a barn he was sharing with Frank, the opossum - I’m not sure what their relationship is, but I like to think that they’re good friends). We haven’t felt ready to adopt a new pup yet, so Bill and his family have been fun to watch in the meantime (also once a new dog is roaming the property, I’m fairly certain that the groundhogs will move on to a new space).</h3>

    <h3>At first, I thought it was just Bill hanging out under the barn, but one day I heard some commotion and saw two of them! They were having a bit of a dispute and retreated to their burrow to further work through things once they spotted me. We named Bill’s mate Billhemina.</h3>

    <h2>*note* Bill and Billhemina are very fast and elude my camera the majority of the time. The kids are slower and I’m able to get clearer photos of them.
